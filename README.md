# Litmus chaos-operator for injecting chaos experiments on Kubernetes

<This is a WIP> 
  
Litmus chaos operator is used by Kubernetes application developers and SREs to inject chaos experiments into the applications and Kubernetes infrastructure in a managed fashion. It is easy to validate and harden the stateful applications and Kubernetes infrastructure. The chaos injection workflow is simple to use:

- Install Litmus using helm chart that installs chaos operator, litmus charts for different applications and chaos engine templates
- Link your application to a chaos engine
- Start injecting instant chaos or start scheduling chaos injection using chaos engine definition
